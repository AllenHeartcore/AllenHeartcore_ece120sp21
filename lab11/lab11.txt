QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab11.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab11.bin.)

ANSWER: The program should modify R2 in the register file, and it will contain 12 (x000c) when the program finishes. 


QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: When debugging, we often have an expectation about the desired result, and can thus infer how the computer will behave in every step. Through step-by-step execution, we can compare the partial results to our expectation to quickly locate the faulty instruction.
